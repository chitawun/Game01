	<h2>The rules</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>All pipes must form a single contiguous network.</li>
		<li>No connections may run outside the grid.</li>
		<li>Bulb-shaped tiles are deadends.</li>
		<li>Closed loops are not allowed.</li>
		<li>Each puzzle has a unique solution.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Tips for controls</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Click or tap a tile to rotate it.</li>
		<li>
			Lock tiles when you're sure of their orientation. Right click or long press to start locking.
			You can lock multiple tiles by moving the cursor around after that.
		</li>
		<li>
			Make edge marks to mark certain edges as "definitely a wall" or "definitely a connection". <br
			/>
			To make a wall mark draw a line along tile edge with a mouse or your finger. Draw a line across
			the edge for a connection mark. Do the same again to erase.<br />
			With a mouse or touch pad you can also click and hold near the edge middle to make a mark. In this
			case left mouse button makes a wall mark, right button makes a connection mark.
		</li>
		<li>
			Zoom in and out using mouse wheel or pinch-to-zoom on mobile. Click and drag to move around
			the board.
		</li>
		<li>Check out alternative control modes in the settings.</li>
